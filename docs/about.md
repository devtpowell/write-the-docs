# About Me

My name is Devon Powell, and I'm a technical writer specializing in software documentation for end users. 

In the writing field, I am also interested in docs-as-code workflows, technical blog content, and writing for global audiences. In the technology field, I am interested in natural language processing, data science, statistics. More broadly speaking, I am also interested in the application of all of the above for the public good.
